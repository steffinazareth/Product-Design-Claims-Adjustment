# Product Design - Claims Adjustment

## Setup:
Acme Inc. provides insurance services for fully automated, self driving trucks. For the purposes of this project, I assumed the role of a product manager for their upcoming application which their claims adjusters will use to note down details, take pictures etc. 

## Details:
1. The claims adjusters are always on the road, and they travel to the location as informed. 
2. They use self-driving cars to get to the incident location so they don't need directions. 
3. They get a list of incidents at the same time, so they must be able to accept/reject these requests. 
4. They will use the same application to get diagnostics from the vehicle involved in the accident. 
5. They will also use the application to take notes and pictures. 
6. The aforementioned application is backed by AI which makes instant calculations about the insurance amount to be paid. 

## Project Tasks:
1. Wrote user stories and prioritized them by gauging effort and impact while considering the Moscow method.
2. Designed a low-fidelity prototype for the mobile application by relying on UI/UX design principles.
